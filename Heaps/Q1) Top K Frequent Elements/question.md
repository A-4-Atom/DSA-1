## Top K Frequent Elements
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.


Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2 <br>
Output: [1,2] <br>

Example 2: <br>
Input: nums = [1], k = 1 <br>
Output: [1] <br>

Constraints: <br>
1 <= nums.length <= 105<br>
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104<br>

k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].<br>

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.<br>
 
Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
