## Sort Characters By Frequency
Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"<br>
Output: "eert"<br>
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.<br>

Example 2:

Input: s = "cccaaa"<br>
Output: "aaaccc"<br>
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:

Input: s = "Aabb"<br>
Output: "bbAa"<br>
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5<br>
s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.
