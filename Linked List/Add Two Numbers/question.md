# Add Two Numbers

## Problem Description

You are given two non-empty singly linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zeros, except the number `0` itself.

## Examples

### Example 1: 
Given the linked lists:  
  `[2, 4, 3]` (represents 342)  
  `[5, 6, 4]` (represents 465)  
  The result is:  
  `[7, 0, 8]` (represents 807).  
### Example 2: 
Given the linked lists:  
  `[0]` (represents 0)  
  `[0]` (represents 0)  
  The result is:  
  `[0]`.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`.
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number without leading zeros.
