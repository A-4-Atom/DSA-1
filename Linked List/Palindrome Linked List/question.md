# Palindrome Linked List

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a singly linked list. Determine if the linked list is a palindrome. 

A linked list is considered a palindrome if the sequence of values in the nodes is the same forward and backward.


---

## Examples
### Example 1:
Given the linked list:  
  `[1, 2, 2, 1]`  
  The result is `true` because the linked list reads the same forward and backward.  
### Example 2:
Given the linked list:  
  `[1, 2]`  
  The result is `false` because the linked list does not read the same forward and backward.  

---

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`.
