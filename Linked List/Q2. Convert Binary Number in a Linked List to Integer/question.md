# Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a singly linked list where each node contains a single binary digit (`0` or `1`). The entire linked list represents a binary number in sequence from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. 

Your task is to convert this binary number into its decimal integer equivalent and return it.

## Examples

### Example 1: 
Given the linked list:  
  `1 -> 0 -> 1`  
  The binary number is `101`, and the result will be `5`. 
### Example 2: 
Given the linked list:  
  `0`  
  The binary number is `0`, and the result will be `0`.   
### Example 3: 
Given the linked list:  
  `1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1`  
  The binary number is `1111`, and the result will be `15`.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 30]`.
- Each node's value is either `0` or `1`.
