## Problem Description

You are given the head of a singly linked list and an integer `n`. Remove the `n`th node from the end of the list and return its head.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
Given the input list `[1,2,3,4,5]` and `n = 2`, the list after removing the 2nd node from the end will be `[1,2,3,5]`.

### Example 2:
Given the input list `[1]` and `n = 1`, the list after removing the 1st node from the end will be `[]` (empty list).

---

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 30]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`.
- `1 <= n <= size of the list`.
