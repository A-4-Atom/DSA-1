## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input**:  
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

**Output**: 
6

**Explanation**:
The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

### Example 2
**Input**:
height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]

**Output**:
9
