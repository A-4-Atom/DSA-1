* The goal is to add the nodes level wise in zig zag order

1. To take care of the changing levels, we can keep a boolean variable flag.
2. Since it is level order traversal, we use a queue to store the nodes.
3. Until the queue becomes empty, everytime we will calculate the size of queue, and check if they have to be 
added in the order in which they are present or they have to be added in the reverse order in the list
4. If at a level, the nodes are to be added in the order in which they are present in queue, we will add them in 
the linked list at the last position, however if the nodes have to be added in reverse order, then we will
add them in the linked list at the first position. 
5. At each level, we will remove the nodes one by one, and with every node removed, we have to check how they will
be added in the linked list, once they are added, we will add their left and right children nodes in the queue.
6. When all the nodes of a level are removed from queue, we will make the flag variable's behaviour opposite.
