## Symmetric Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e, symmetric around its center). <br> Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] <br>
Output: true <br>

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6829f2eb-4b28-47d6-85ef-40bf3021f623)

Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] <br>
Output: false <br>


Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
