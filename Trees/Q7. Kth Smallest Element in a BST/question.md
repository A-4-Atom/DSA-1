## Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1 <br>
Output: 1 <br>

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd477928-8b59-4a71-90f5-e703ec4f6958)

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3 <br>
Output: 3 <br>


Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is n.
* 1 <= k <= n <= 104
* 0 <= Node.val <= 104
