* The goal is to construct binary tree from inorder and preorder traversal

// RECURSIVE APPROACH
-> We know that inorder traversal(LNR) can tell us about the nodes that are on the left or right side of the root node
and preorder traversal(NLR) tells us about the position of the root node.
-> Hence, by using inorder and preorder sequences, we can build a unique binary tree.

Step 1. Start from the first index in preorder array and it will serve as the root node of the tree.
Step 2. Then, find the position of the root node created in the inorder array so that the array can be split 
into two parts that will form the left and right subtree.
Step 3. Once the position is located in the inorder array, the array from index (start, pos-1) will contain the 
nodes in left subtree and the array from index (pos+1, end) will contain the nodes in right subtree.
Step 4. Make recursive calls for building the left and right subtree.
-> The thing that needs to be determined is the index that will now become the root of left and right subtrees.
-> If root was at index (idx), then root of left subtree would be (idx+1) and right subtree would be (idx+(pos-start+1)).
Step 5. Return the root node.
