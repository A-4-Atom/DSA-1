## Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a 
height-balanced binary search tree.

Example 1:

Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9] <br>
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5] <br>
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST. <br>

Example 2:  <br>

Input: head = [] <br>
Output: [] <br>
 

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 104].
* -105 <= Node.val <= 105
